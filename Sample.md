This is the GitHub Workshop Day 2 to learn about 
* Markdown with the .MD suffix
* Creating repository
* Pull request

The  following tools are used for this workshop:

* VScode
* Github

To write using VScode you need to create a file and save it as markdown. Markdown comes with the surfix .MD 

When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
